/*
Building an app
What app?
An  extentable app.
What does that mean?
I'm seeing a tree of components, each responsible for a certain task.
A tree because certain components can use other components which their functionality depends on.

How to deliver it?



The build is working, so what now?

Create an OO way of handling things like a Target class

A Target is part of a build. Consisting of a bunch of files that share the same
compiler, linker and other flags.
